module Resque
  # A Resque::Job represents a unit of work. Each job lives on a
  # single queue and has an associated payload object. The payload
  # is a hash with two attributes: `class` and `args`. The `class` is
  # the name of the Ruby class which should be used to run the
  # job. The `args` are an array of arguments which should be passed
  # to the Ruby class's `perform` class-level method.
  #
  # You can manually run a job using this code:
  #
  #   job = Resque::Job.reserve(:high)
  #   klass = Resque::Job.constantize(job.payload['class'])
  #   klass.perform(*job.payload['args'])
